    "# Connect Four Reinforcement Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, I aim to build a machine learning model that can play and win a game of Connect Four. To do this, I intend to use a reinforcement learning framework to train the model to recognize the correct move to make at each turn in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect Four is a 2-player board game with simpe rules.  The board is a 6x7 grid (six rows, seven columns) that stands upright.  Both players take turns placing their pieces, which are marked with different colors, into the columns of the board.  Since the board stands upright, when a player places his or her piece into a column, the piece falls down to fill the bottommost empty slot.  The goal of the game is to place your pieces such that they form a straight line of four adjacent pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to play this game a lot when I was about 10 years old, and from what I remember of playing the game, the first few moves tend to involve some randomness and \"creativity,\" but specific strategies take over as the board takes shape.  For example, later in the game, it is smart to place your pieces to \"block\" your opponent from creating a \"run\" of 3 pieces.  As another example, it is good strategy to try and create two \"runs\" of three pieces, either of which can be played on for a win -- and to prevent your opponent from doing the same."

Below are a number of helper functions that `play_game()` will call over the course of a game."

    "## Accumulating game data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `play_game()` function plays a single game of Connect Four -- right now with players making random choices -- and record the history of choices, states, and the winner.  My goal with the next section of this notebook is to accumulate data on many games, and store the data in a format that can be used as input to a machine learning model to produce predicitons about the \"best\" choice to make on a given turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_df()` function calls the `play_game()` function many times to simulate many games of Connect Four.  At the end of the game, the board history, choices history, and winner are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am representing my data as a `pandas DataFrame`; each row in the `DataFrame` represents a board state at a given turn in a given game, as well as the choice of play (right now random) that player 1 made when confronted with that state.  Finally, each row also contains the calculated \"reward\" resulting from each state-choice combination (more on this two paragraphs below).\n",
    "\n",
    "While coding this section of the notebook, I realized that while Connect Four is a relatively simple game compared to a Chess or a Go, there is an incredibly large state space, or number of possible board configurations.  Since each of the 42 slots can take on 3 possible states (empty, taken by player 1 or taken by player 2), there are 3^42 possible states.  Even when you consider that most of those states are illegal -- you can't have a gravity-defying configuration, nor can you have an imbalance of player tokens -- there are still something like 1.6 X 10^16 legal states.  That is far too many to enumerate and check against.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fascinating problem to me because it forces me as the code designer to make some decisions about how to represent the state space in a tractable way.  These decisions will have ramifications as to the prediciton ability of my ultimate model.  Since there are so many possible board configurations, it is not tractable to search them exhaustively.  This is a similar problem that needed to be creatively solved to build machines that can win at much more complex games like Chess and Go.  I've got a friend that is grappling with a similar problem at the moment trying to build a bot that can win at Poker.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I will make what I think is a drastic simplification: I will fit my model with data on states that have been \"seen.\"  If a player then runs into a state that it has never seen before, then it will fall back on a random choice to place its piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major decision that I have to make at this point is how I will record the \"reward\" that each play results in.  Again, I will make a modeling decision here (which I might revise later) which will have a significant impact on my modeling ability.  This is because the reward is the value that my model will ultimately try to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, this is how I will calculate the reward that results from a given move.  If a game is lost, all moves in the game are assigned a reward of zero.  If a game results in a win, Each move is given a nonzero reward value.  Each move's reward will be an element in an exponential sequence, so that the final move (the one that results in a win), has a reward of 1, and each move leading up to that is scored somewhat lower.  The idea is that early moves will have a low reward, and later moves will have a higher reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of this data is prepped and in `DataFrame` format, it will be ready to use as training input for my model."
